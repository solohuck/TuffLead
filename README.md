## Description
As developers of this food-flavored pencil subscription app, our goal is to create a convenient and customizable service that delivers high-quality, food-flavored pencils to customers' doors every month. The app will feature a user-friendly design, with clear calls-to-action and simple, intuitive menus. Customers will be able to choose from a range of charcoal pencils that all have a unique food-inspired flavor. The app will also include a secure and reliable payment processing system to make it easy for customers to subscribe and manage their accounts. With this app, we aim to provide a user-friendly and engaging experience for customers, making it easy for them to sign up and enjoy their monthly deliveries of food-flavored pencils.
